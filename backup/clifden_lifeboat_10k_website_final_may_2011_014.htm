		The Clifden Lifeboat 10k race was held on Sunday 14th September. The atrocious weather conditions in the morning did not deter everyone, and some people even decided to join us on the day. Out of about 150  registered, almost 110 took part.<br> 
		A sudden change in the weather just before the race started, made for a fairly dry race except for the floods. The route took the runners up the sky rd and back to finish outside the Alcock and Brown Hotel, and was described by some as the most challenging run they had ever done.The first runner to come across the line was Iain Egan from Galway in 38.51 mins, and the first woman was sue Znlay, from Dublin, in 45.10 mins. The first team were the Fuerty Harriers from Wicklow and the first local person to come in was alan Keogh in 45 mins.<br>
