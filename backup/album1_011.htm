		The race is held in Clifden, Co Galway and starts at the Court House, across from the Topaz petrol station. It is an out and back route, which goes up the scenic Sky road and while walkers will be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery and views of Clifden Bay, it is challenging enough for any serious runners. It returns by the Thomas Whelan Memorial, to finish outside the Alcock and Brown Hotel in the town centre. From the Start at the Court House, follow the N59 towards Westport for about 100 metres, before taking the first left onto Churchill. Follow this road to the end. Keep right onto the Sky Road. Continue for about 4 kms where you will see a rough road branching to the right into a quarry. This is your turn back point. You cannot miss it, as there will be a water station and race marshalls in attendance.
