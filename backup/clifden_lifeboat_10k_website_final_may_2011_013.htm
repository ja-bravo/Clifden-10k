		A crowd of about 120 competitors turned out to take part in the 2nd Clifden Lifeboat 10k race on sunday 13th September 2009. <br> 
		Entries came from all over county Galway, as well as Mayo, Cork, Kildare, Dublin, Tyrone as well as 2 from the USA. <br> 
		The weather was very different from last year, with clear blue skies. This made a challenging course, harder as the temperatures were up into the 20's C by race start at 2pm. <br> 
		<br>
